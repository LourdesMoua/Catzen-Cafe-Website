            <p>
                Babybel, our Beloved Fromage, our Large Loaf of Lemon Pound Cake, our Puff Pastry with Paws, weighs in at a demure 29.8 pounds. This king could use to lose some of his heft, and we are in the process of helping him with that goal. No Ozempic for our sweet wheel of cheese, just some pain meds to help him get up and around.</p>
            <p>
                Babybel is the perfectly toasted marshmallow we didn't know we needed. His absolutely sweet demeanor, soft snow-white fur, and pumpkin-orange spots, are outshone only by his eyes, which are the perfect shade of “I-see-you-but-I’m-not-moving" sapphire. Bask in his glory and pet his superb belly, for an immediate serotonin hit.</p>

                    Halloween Blizzard of '91, (Holly for short) is a tall and furry princess with striking eyes the color of a matcha latte and a loooong tail. Much like her name, she will appear when you least expect her. Holly is soft as a cotton ball, and playful as a..well...a kitten. The sun glinting off her sparkling white fur makes her as unforgettable as her name. She will be patiently waiting to welcome you and make your acquaintance when you join us in the Living Room, and best of all: no shoveling required.</p>

                    Need we say more? Leeroy loves to throw himself into playtime with lack of thought and total disregard for consequences, much like his namesake. Experience the joy of his soft fur and ridiculous floppy tummy as he sidles up to you with a golden side-eye. Leeroy loves everybody except his nemesis, the Flower Cat Tower. You may occasionally see him engaged in his own personal battle with it.</p>

                    AKA Full of Beans, Bean Bean, Beanie Baby, and Beanarooni, came to us as part of an unwanted litter. Unwanted no more, he moonlights as a feline philosopher, contemplating the profound questions of existence while perched in the window: "Is the red dot a cosmic conspiracy?" “If I knock a glass off the counter, does it make a sound in a parallel universe?”Beans is a big boy. You can tell him from his sister, because Beans wears an orange collar.</p>

                    Bialetti ("Letti" for short), is the sister of Beans. Like her namesake, is a lot in a small package. Sleeker than a ninja in a silk suit, her obsidian fur glistens like a moonlit puddle. Her ears are like satellite dishes tuned to the cosmic radio station of mischief. Letti is a sweet, gentle soul who loves to curl up in a lap (but let her come to you!). Letti wears a purple collar. She takes her coffee black with a small dollop of cream, like her fur.</p>

                    Did you do a double take? No, it's not a tiny werewolf. It's just Tim the Enchanter, our very own Loveable Lykoi. His golden eyes say, "I could transform at any moment, but I'll settle for knocking this glass off the table instead." Lykoi cats are known for their sparse hair, but it doesn't make them any less cuddly. Sit down in the living room and discover one of Tim's two speeds: asleep in his yurt next to the fireplace, or fighting demons only he can see. He won't ask you questions three, but he will be happy to listen to any perplexing conundrums you may wish to pose. Tim's motto is, "your personal space is also my personal space."</p>

                    Big Cup o' Joe, AKA Big Joe, is an enormous Maine Coon rescue. His fierce silver eyes have seen kingdoms rise and fall and will stare into your soul. Don't let his majestic stance fool you: he is a massive baby who will stride over to you and nudge you when he wants attention. One moment, he's a mythical beast guarding treasure; the next, he's curled up on your lap, pushing his head into your hand like a fluffy, purring battleship. And then there's that flopping right ear: he'll tell you it's avante garde. Approach with awe, love, and a lint roller.</p>

                    Boudica is named for the fierce British warrior queen who led the Britons in revolt against the Romans. This wee lass is compact as a dram of fine Scotch whisky. A fun fact about our Boo is that her round head is full of porridge. Her ears are folded to keep the porridge from coming out. She's not a big fan of lap cuddles, but she sure is cute. Favorite quote: “Ach, this Glenfiddich has notes of oak and rebellion." Likes: oatmeal, pillows, naps. Dislikes: Haggis. No really. It's awful.</p>
